# WipeCounter

This is my personal project that I made using Java. The idea of the project was to create a simple counter app that works by using hotkeys (Currently F9 & F10) on the keyboard to increase or decrease number of "wipes" or resets in a video game, shown on the counter. The problem when creating this app with Java was that I needed the app to work on background while unfocused so I could use the hotkeys while in game. I used a library called jNativeHook to make my keyEvents nativeKeyEvents that work on background while the app is unfocused.
